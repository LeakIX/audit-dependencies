### Related Python Asyncio Vulnerability (Not pytest-asyncio)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| CVE ID | CVE-2024-12254 |
| Severity | HIGH |
| Affected Package | Python core asyncio module |
| Affected Versions | Python 3.12.0+ |
| Status | **NOT APPLICABLE to pytest-asyncio** |

**Description**: A memory exhaustion vulnerability in Python's core asyncio
module affecting the `.writelines()` method with zero-copy-on-write behavior.

**Impact on pytest-asyncio**: **NONE** - This CVE affects Python's core asyncio
module, not the pytest-asyncio testing library. pytest-asyncio is a testing
plugin that uses Python's asyncio but does not introduce this vulnerability.

**Conditions for CVE-2024-12254**: You must be using Python 3.12.0+, on macOS or
Linux, using asyncio with protocols, and using the `.writelines()` method. If
not all conditions are met, you are not affected.

## Security Best Practices

When using pytest-asyncio:

1. **Keep pytest-asyncio updated** - Always use the latest version
2. **Use compatible Python versions** - Ensure Python >= 3.9
3. **Review async test fixtures** - Ensure async fixtures don't leak resources
4. **Isolate test environments** - Use virtual environments for testing
5. **Don't run untrusted tests** - pytest executes arbitrary Python code
6. **Update Python** - If using Python 3.12+, ensure latest patch for
   CVE-2024-12254
