## Summary

The `pytest` framework is the most popular Python testing framework with
approximately 43 million weekly downloads. It is classified as a "key ecosystem
project" with excellent package health (96/100 on Snyk).

**pytest has never been associated with a direct security vulnerability.**

**Recommendation**: SAFE to use at version 9.0.2

## Known Vulnerabilities

### Direct Vulnerabilities: None

pytest has no CVEs directly assigned to it. The project has maintained a clean
security record throughout its 15-year history.

### Indirect/Historical: CVE-2022-42969 (py library dependency)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| CVE ID | CVE-2022-42969 |
| Severity | HIGH (NIST) / MEDIUM (disputed) |
| CVSS Score | 7.5 (NIST) / 5.3 (MITRE, disputed) |
| CWE | CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) |
| Affected Package | py library (<= 1.11.0) |
| Affected pytest Versions | < 7.2.0 (had py dependency) |
| Fixed Version | pytest 7.2.0 (removed py dependency) |
| Status | **DISPUTED** - Multiple parties claim not reproducible |

**Description**: The `py` library through version 1.11.0 allows remote attackers
to conduct a ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) attack via a
Subversion repository with crafted info data, due to mishandling of the
`InfoSvnCommand` argument in `py.path.svnwc`.

**Impact on pytest**: **NONE** - The pytest maintainers confirmed that the
affected code path (`py.path.svnwc`) was never used by pytest. The-Compiler
(pytest maintainer) stated: "The affected code is not used in pytest (or
anywhere else relevant, for that matter), so you can safely ignore that."

**Resolution**: pytest 7.2.0+ removed the `py` library dependency entirely,
eliminating any theoretical concern.

**Dispute Status**: This CVE is disputed by multiple third parties who argue it
is not reproducible and should not be considered a valid vulnerability.

## Security Best Practices

When using pytest:

1. **Keep pytest updated** - Always use the latest version (currently 9.0.2)
2. **Review test fixtures** - Ensure test fixtures don't expose sensitive data
3. **Isolate test environments** - Use virtual environments for testing
4. **Don't run untrusted tests** - pytest executes arbitrary Python code
5. **Review plugins** - Third-party pytest plugins may have their own
   vulnerabilities; audit them separately
