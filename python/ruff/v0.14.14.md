advisories in the NVD or Snyk databases.

### Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities

#### CVE-2025-4574: crossbeam-channel Double Free

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **CVE ID** | CVE-2025-4574 |
| **GHSA ID** | GHSA-pg9f-39pc-qf8g |
| **RustSec ID** | RUSTSEC-2025-0024 |
| **Severity** | Medium (CVSS 3.1: 6.5) |
| **Affected Component** | crossbeam-channel (Rust crate) |
| **Vulnerable Versions** | 0.5.12 - 0.5.14 |
| **Patched Version** | >= 0.5.15 |
| **Disclosed** | 2025-04-10 |
| **Published** | 2025-05-15 |

**Description:**

A race condition in the `crossbeam-channel` Rust crate's internal `Channel`
type `Drop` method could, in some circumstances, lead to a double-free that
could result in memory corruption.

The bug was introduced while fixing a memory leak in upstream MR #1084, first
published in version 0.5.12. The `discard_all_messages` function contained two
paths that could lead to `head.block` being read, but only one of them would
swap the value. This asymmetry allowed the function to attempt freeing a
pointer without nullifying it first, causing `Channel::drop` to free the same
memory twice.

**CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L`

- **Attack Vector:** Network
- **Attack Complexity:** Low
- **Privileges Required:** None
- **User Interaction:** None
- **Confidentiality Impact:** None
- **Integrity Impact:** Low
- **Availability Impact:** Low

**Impact:**

- Memory corruption
- Application crashes
- Potential (but unlikely) arbitrary code execution in specific scenarios

**Remediation:**

Ruff distributions have been rebuilt to use crossbeam-channel >= 0.5.15.
Fedora 41 and 42 released updated ruff packages (version 0.11.5-2) addressing
this issue in May 2025.

## Risk Assessment

| Category | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Direct Code Vulnerabilities** | Low | No known CVEs for ruff itself |
| **Dependency Chain** | Low-Medium | One transitive vulnerability (CVE-2025-4574) in crossbeam-channel, patched |
| **Supply Chain** | Low | Maintained by Astral, well-established company |
| **Maintenance** | Low | Active development, frequent releases |

## Recommendations

1. **Update to Latest Version:** Ensure you are running ruff >= 0.11.5 to
   include the crossbeam-channel fix for CVE-2025-4574.

2. **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to GitHub security advisories
   for the astral-sh/ruff repository.

3. **Use Package Managers with Security Scanning:** Tools like pip-audit or
   safety can detect known vulnerabilities in Python dependencies.

4. **Verify Installation Source:** Always install from PyPI
   (`pip install ruff`) to ensure authenticity.

## Conclusion

Ruff is considered **safe to use** for production environments. The package
has no direct security vulnerabilities. The only notable security concern is a
transitive dependency vulnerability (CVE-2025-4574) in the crossbeam-channel
Rust crate, which has been patched in recent ruff releases. The project
demonstrates strong security practices with a documented security policy,
active maintenance, and rapid response to dependency vulnerabilities.
