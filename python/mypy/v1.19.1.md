# Security Audit: mypy v1.19.1

## Package Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Package Name | mypy |
| Version | 1.19.1 |
| Release Date | December 15, 2025 |
| License | MIT |
| Author | Jukka Lehtosalo |
| Homepage | https://www.mypy-lang.org/ |
| Repository | https://github.com/python/mypy |
| PyPI | https://pypi.org/project/mypy/ |
| Python Requirement | >= 3.9 |

## Description

Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python. It adds type annotations
to Python programs and performs type checking to catch programming errors
without executing the code. Mypy features a sophisticated type system
supporting type inference, gradual typing, generics, and union types.

## Security Assessment

| Maintenance | Sustainable | Active development, 132 versions released |
| Community | Active | 13 maintainers, Code of Conduct present |

### Security Policy

**Not established.** The mypy repository lacks a formal SECURITY.md file,
which represents a gap in coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes.
Security issues should be reported to security@python.org or via GitHub
Security Advisories.

## Risk Analysis

### Attack Surface

Mypy is a **static analysis tool** that:

- Does not execute untrusted code by design
- Processes Python source files for type checking
- Does not make network connections during analysis
- Does not handle sensitive data at runtime

This architecture inherently limits its attack surface compared to runtime
dependencies.

### Dependency Chain

- **Direct dependencies**: 0
- **Indirect vulnerabilities**: 0

### Potential Risks

1. **Malicious code in analyzed files**: While mypy parses Python source, it
   does not execute it. However, parsing malformed files could theoretically
   trigger bugs.

2. **Build-time execution**: When mypy is installed via pip, setup scripts
   execute. This is a standard Python package risk, not specific to mypy.

3. **mypyc compiled extensions**: Mypy includes mypyc-compiled modules for
   performance. These are pre-compiled and signed by the mypy maintainers.

## Recommendations

### Approved for Use

Mypy v1.19.1 is **approved** for use in development environments.

### Best Practices

1. **Pin the version**: Use `mypy==1.19.1` in requirements files
2. **Verify integrity**: Use pip's hash verification for production CI
3. **Monitor updates**: Subscribe to mypy releases for security patches
4. **CI integration**: Run mypy in CI pipelines to catch type errors early

### Example Requirements Entry

```txt
mypy==1.19.1 \
    --hash=sha256:<get-from-pypi>
```
