#### Description

React applications using the `ReactDOMServer` API failed to escape user-supplied
attribute names during server-side rendering, creating a cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerability. The package failed to validate attribute names in HTML tags
which could lead to XSS in specific scenarios.

#### Attack Requirements

The vulnerability requires three conditions:

1. Server-side React application
2. HTML rendering via `ReactDOMServer`
3. Inclusion of user-input attribute names in HTML tags

#### Affected Versions

| Vulnerable Range | Patched Version |
| --- | --- |
| 16.0.0 | 16.0.1 |
| 16.1.0 - 16.1.1 | 16.1.2 |
| 16.2.0 | 16.2.1 |
| 16.3.0 - 16.3.2 | 16.3.3 |
| 16.4.0 - 16.4.1 | 16.4.2 |

#### Remediation

Upgrade to version 16.4.2 or later. All versions from 16.5.0 onwards are not
affected.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Latest Version**: The current version 19.2.4 is secure and recommended
2. **Avoid Legacy Versions**: Do not use versions prior to 16.4.2
3. **Server-Side Rendering**: If using `ReactDOMServer`, ensure you are on a
   patched version
