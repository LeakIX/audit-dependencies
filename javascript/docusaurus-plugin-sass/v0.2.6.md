## Recommendations

### For Current Use

1. **APPROVED** - Safe to use in production
2. Monitor for future advisories via `npm audit` or Snyk
3. Consider pinning to exact version (`0.2.6`) rather than range

### For Long-term Projects

1. **Monitor maintenance status** - Project shows signs of inactivity
2. **Alternative consideration** - For critical projects, consider:
   - Using Docusaurus built-in SASS support if available in future versions
   - Forking the repository if maintenance lapses

### Security Best Practices

1. Run `npm audit --production` regularly to check for transitive vulnerabilities
2. Use `npm audit` in CI/CD pipelines
3. Consider using `npm-audit-resolver` for managing audit exceptions

## Conclusion

**APPROVED FOR USE**

is lightweight (single dependency on sass-loader) and serves a narrow purpose.
The primary concern is the inactive maintenance status, which should be monitored
for long-term projects.
