# Security Audit: @docusaurus/core v3.9.2

**Audit Date:** 2026-02-01
**Package:** @docusaurus/core
**Version:** 3.9.2 (latest)
**Release Date:** October 17, 2025
**License:** MIT
**Repository:** https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus

## Overview

Docusaurus is a static site generator maintained by Facebook/Meta for building
documentation websites. It uses React, Webpack, and MDX for content authoring.

## Direct Vulnerabilities

**Status: No known direct CVEs**

According to Snyk's vulnerability database and GitHub Advisory Database, no
direct security vulnerabilities have been reported against the `@docusaurus/core`
package itself.

## Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities

The following vulnerabilities exist in nested dependencies. The Docusaurus
maintainers have assessed these as **low risk** because they only affect the
build process, not the generated static site.

### Historical Issues (Resolved)

| Dependency | CVE | Severity | Status |
|------------|-----|----------|--------|
| trim@0.0.1 | CVE-2020-7753 | High (ReDoS) | Fixed in MDX v2 upgrade |

### Build-Only Dependencies (Low Risk)

These vulnerabilities exist in dev-time dependencies and do not affect
production deployments:

| Dependency | Issue | Risk Assessment |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| shelljs@0.8.5 | Deprecated | Removed in v3.8+ |
| inflight@1.0.6 | Deprecated (via glob) | Removed with shelljs |
| express@4.x | Various CVEs | Dev server only |
| serve-handler@6.1.5 | Deprecated | Dev server only |

### React Router Concerns (Not Applicable)

- **Issue:** react-router <=7.5.1 has cache poisoning vulnerabilities
  (GHSA-cpj6-fhp6-mr6j, GHSA-f46r-rw29-r322)
- **Status:** Not affected - Docusaurus v3.x uses React Router v5, not v7
- **Future:** Upgrade to React Router v7 planned for Docusaurus v4

## Related Plugin Vulnerability

**Note:** This affects a third-party plugin, not @docusaurus/core itself.

| Plugin | CVE | Severity | Fixed Version |
|--------|-----|----------|---------------|
| docusaurus-plugin-content-gists | CVE-2025-53624 | Critical (10.0) | 4.0.0 |

The gists plugin exposed GitHub Personal Access Tokens in build artifacts.
Upgrade to v4.0.0+ if using this plugin.

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk: Low**

Docusaurus generates static HTML sites. Security vulnerabilities in build-time
dependencies cannot affect end users of the generated site unless:

1. An attacker has write access to the source repository
2. Malicious content is intentionally committed

The Docusaurus team's security philosophy: "There's no way a user could be
exploited by any security vulnerability whatsoever, unless they actively XSS
themselves."

## Recommendations

1. **Keep Docusaurus updated** - v3.9.2 is current and recommended
2. **Audit third-party plugins** - Plugins may have their own vulnerabilities
3. **Use npm audit** - Review warnings but understand context (build vs runtime)
4. **Content Security** - Focus on content review rather than build-time deps
