## Direct Vulnerabilities

**Status**: No known vulnerabilities

No security advisories have been found for `@types/node` in:

- [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories)
- npm audit database

### Risk Assessment

`@types/node` is a **TypeScript type definitions package** from DefinitelyTyped.
It provides type information for Node.js APIs and **does not contain executable
runtime code**. This significantly reduces its attack surface compared to
packages with runtime code.

Type definition packages are consumed only at compile time by the TypeScript
compiler and are not included in production bundles.

## Dependency Vulnerabilities

### undici-types (~7.16.0)

`undici-types` provides TypeScript type definitions for the `undici` HTTP client.
Like `@types/node`, it contains only type definitions without executable code.

**Note**: While the parent `undici` package has had vulnerabilities, the
`undici-types` package itself has no known direct vulnerabilities.

#### Related undici Vulnerabilities (for reference)

The following vulnerabilities affect the `undici` runtime package (not
`undici-types`):

| CVE | Severity | Description | Fixed In |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------|
| CVE-2026-22036 | - | Unbounded decompression chain allows CPU/memory exhaustion | 7.18.0, 6.23.0 |
| CVE-2025-22150 | Medium | Insecure randomness in multipart boundary selection | 5.28.5, 6.21.1, 7.2.3 |

These vulnerabilities do **not** affect `undici-types` or `@types/node` directly,
as they only provide type definitions.

## Node.js Runtime Vulnerabilities (Reference)

While not affecting this package, these Node.js runtime vulnerabilities are
relevant for projects using Node.js:

### January 2026 Security Release

| CVE | Severity | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| CVE-2025-55131 | High | Timeout-based race conditions exposing uninitialized buffer memory |
| CVE-2025-55130 | High | Permissions model bypass via crafted symlink paths |
| CVE-2025-59465 | High | HTTP/2 HEADERS frame crash (DoS) |
| CVE-2025-59464 | Medium | Memory leak in TLS certificate processing |
| CVE-2025-59466 | Medium | Uncatchable stack overflow via async_hooks |
| CVE-2026-21637 | Medium | TLS callback exceptions bypass error handlers |
| CVE-2026-21636 | Medium | Permission model bypass via Unix Domain Sockets (v25.x only) |

**Patched versions**: 20.20.0, 22.22.0, 24.13.0, 25.3.0

## Recommendation
