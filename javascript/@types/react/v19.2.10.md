## Security Assessment

### Direct Vulnerabilities

**Status: No known vulnerabilities**

The `@types/react` package contains only TypeScript type definitions and does
not include any runtime code. As a type-only package, it:

- Does not execute any code at runtime
- Is stripped during TypeScript compilation
- Cannot introduce runtime security vulnerabilities
- Is used only during development/build time

### Snyk Advisory Status

According to [Snyk's vulnerability database](https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/%40types%2Freact):

> No direct vulnerabilities have been found for the @types/react package.

### npm Advisory Status

No security advisories found for `@types/react` in the npm advisory database.

## Related React Vulnerabilities (Important Context)

While `@types/react` itself has no vulnerabilities, the underlying `react`
package has critical vulnerabilities that users should be aware of:

### CVE-2025-55182 (React2Shell) - CRITICAL

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| CVE | CVE-2025-55182 |
| CVSS v3.x | 10.0 (Critical) |
| CVSS v4 | 9.3 (Critical) |
| Component | React Server Components (Flight protocol) |
| Affected React Versions | 19.0.0-19.0.2, 19.1.0-19.1.3, 19.2.0-19.2.2 |

**Description:** Unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in React
Server Components. Attackers can execute arbitrary code via a single malicious
HTTP request. Default configurations are vulnerable.

**Patched Versions:**
- React: 19.0.3+, 19.1.4+, 19.2.3+
- Next.js: 15.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6, 15.4.8, 15.5.7, 16.0.7

**Note:** If your application does not use React Server Components or a
framework that supports them, you are not affected.

### Related CVEs

- **CVE-2025-55184** (CVSS 7.5 High) - Denial of Service
- **CVE-2025-55183** (CVSS 5.3 Medium) - Source Code Exposure
- **CVE-2025-67779** - Additional DoS vulnerability (follow-up fix)

## Recommendations

1. **For @types/react:** Safe to use. No security action required for the type
   definitions package itself.

2. **For react runtime:** Ensure you are using a patched version of the `react`
   package (19.0.3+, 19.1.4+, or 19.2.3+) if using React Server Components.

3. **Version Alignment:** When upgrading `react`, also upgrade `@types/react`
   to ensure type definitions match the runtime version.

## Audit Summary

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Direct vulnerabilities | None |
| Transitive vulnerabilities | N/A (no dependencies) |
| npm advisories | None |
| Snyk advisories | None |
| Malicious code indicators | None |
| License compliance | MIT (permissive) |

**Overall Risk: LOW**

This package is safe to use as a development dependency. It contains no runtime
code and cannot introduce security vulnerabilities into your application.
