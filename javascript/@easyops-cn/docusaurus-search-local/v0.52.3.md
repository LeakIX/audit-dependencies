### Dependency Vulnerability Notes

#### debug (^4.2.0)

The `debug` package has historical vulnerabilities:

1. **CVE-2025-59144** (HIGH) - Malware in version 4.4.2 after npm account
   takeover
   - Affected: = 4.4.2
   - Fixed: 4.4.3
   - The version constraint `^4.2.0` could resolve to 4.4.2 if not locked

2. **CVE-2017-16137** (LOW) - ReDoS vulnerability
   - Affected: >= 4.0.0, < 4.3.1
   - Fixed: 4.3.1
   - The version constraint `^4.2.0` should resolve to a patched version

**Recommendation:** Ensure your lockfile pins debug to version 4.4.3 or later,
avoiding 4.4.2 specifically.

## Security Considerations

### Build-time vs Runtime

This package runs at **build time** during Docusaurus site generation, not in
the browser or on a server handling user requests. This limits the attack
surface since:

- No direct user input processing at runtime
- Search index is generated during build
- Client-side search uses the pre-built index

### Supply Chain Risk

- Package is actively maintained (last published 2026-01-29)
- Uses npm package signatures for integrity verification
- Multiple maintainers reduce single-point-of-failure risk
- TypeScript source with professional tooling (Jest, ESLint, Prettier)

## Recommendations

1. **Lock dependencies:** Use a lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to
   ensure consistent dependency versions

2. **Monitor debug package:** The `debug` dependency had a supply chain attack
   in September 2025. Verify your resolved version is not 4.4.2

3. **Regular updates:** Keep the package updated as the maintainer releases
   security fixes

4. **Audit transitive dependencies:** Run `npm audit` periodically to check for
   new vulnerabilities in the dependency tree

## Conclusion

**Risk Level: LOW**

The package has no known direct vulnerabilities. The main concern is the
transitive dependency on `debug`, which experienced a supply chain attack in
September 2025. Ensure your lockfile does not resolve to debug@4.4.2.

The build-time nature of this plugin significantly reduces its attack surface
compared to runtime dependencies.
