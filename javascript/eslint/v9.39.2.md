# Security Audit: eslint v9.39.2

**Audit Date:** 2026-02-01
**Package:** eslint
**Version:** 9.39.2 (latest)
**License:** MIT
**Repository:** https://github.com/eslint/eslint
**Homepage:** https://eslint.org
**npm Registry:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint

## Package Overview

ESLint is an AST-based pattern checker for JavaScript. It is one of the most
widely used linting tools in the JavaScript ecosystem with millions of weekly
downloads.

**Maintained Versions:**

- Latest: 9.39.2
- Maintenance: 8.57.1
- Next (pre-release): 10.0.0-rc.2

## Security Assessment

### Overall Risk: LOW (for current version)

The core ESLint package has a good security track record. The primary security
concerns in the ESLint ecosystem have been supply chain attacks targeting
maintainer accounts rather than vulnerabilities in the code itself.

## Known Vulnerabilities

### CVE-2025-50537 - Stack Overflow (FIXED in 9.26.0)

**Description:** A Stack Overflow vulnerability exists in
`eslint/lib/shared/serialization.js` when serializing objects with circular
references. The exploit is triggered via `RuleTester.run()` method during test
case validation.

**Status:** FIXED - Version 9.39.2 is not affected.

## Historical Security Incidents

### 2018 - eslint-scope Supply Chain Attack

**Date:** July 12, 2018
**Affected Packages:**

- eslint-scope@3.7.2
- eslint-config-eslint@5.0.2

**Impact:** An attacker compromised an ESLint maintainer's npm account using
credentials from a third-party breach. Malicious postinstall scripts were
published that exfiltrated `.npmrc` files (containing npm authentication tokens)
to an external server. Approximately 4,500 tokens were potentially compromised.

**Root Cause:** Maintainer password reuse and lack of 2FA on npm account.

**Resolution:** Malicious packages were unpublished within hours. npm revoked
all access tokens issued before 12:30 UTC on July 12, 2018.

**Reference:** https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes/

### 2025 - eslint-config-prettier Supply Chain Attack (CVE-2025-54313)

**Date:** July 18, 2025
**Affected Packages:**

- eslint-config-prettier@8.10.1, 9.1.1, 10.1.6, 10.1.7
- eslint-plugin-prettier (related)
- synckit, @pkgr/core, napi-postinstall (same attack)

**Impact:** Maintainer's npm token was stolen via phishing (spoofed npmjs.com
login page at npnjs.com). Malicious code attempted to load a DLL via rundll32
on Windows systems. The attack window was approximately 2 hours before all
malicious versions were removed.

**Note:** This affected eslint-config-prettier, NOT the core eslint package.

**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High) - but only affects Windows systems.

## Related Package Vulnerabilities

### CVE-2019-15657 - eslint-utils Arbitrary Code Execution

**Affected:** eslint-utils >= 1.2.0 < 1.4.1
**CVSS:** 9.8 (Critical)
**Note:** This is a separate package, not part of core ESLint.

### CVE-2020-15366 - ajv Prototype Pollution (Transitive)

**Affected:** eslint < 5.0.0-rc.0 (via ajv@5.5.2 dependency)
**Note:** Fixed since eslint@5.0.0-rc.0.

## Recommendations

### For Current Usage

1. **Use version 9.26.0 or higher** to avoid CVE-2025-50537
2. **Version 9.39.2 is safe** - no known vulnerabilities
3. **Use lock files** (package-lock.json) to prevent automatic upgrades to
   potentially compromised versions

### For Development Teams

1. **Monitor npm advisories** for eslint and its ecosystem packages
2. **Verify package integrity** using `npm audit` regularly
3. **Be cautious with related packages** - supply chain attacks have targeted
   eslint-config-prettier and eslint-scope, not the core package

### Supply Chain Security

The ESLint ecosystem has been targeted by supply chain attacks multiple times.
Consider:

1. Pinning exact versions in production
2. Using npm audit in CI pipelines
3. Reviewing dependency updates before merging
4. Using tools like Socket.dev or Snyk for real-time monitoring

## Dependency Count

ESLint 9.39.2 has 34 direct dependencies. Notable dependencies include:

- @eslint/core
- @eslint/config-array
- @eslint/js
- espree (JavaScript parser)
- Various utility packages

## Conclusion

**eslint@9.39.2 is safe to use.** The only vulnerability affecting the core
package (CVE-2025-50537) was fixed in version 9.26.0. The main security concerns
in the ESLint ecosystem relate to supply chain attacks on related packages and
maintainer accounts, not code vulnerabilities in ESLint itself.
