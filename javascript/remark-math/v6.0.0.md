### Dependency Vulnerabilities

**mdast-util-to-hast (Indirect Dependency) - CVE-2025-66400**

While not a direct dependency of remark-math, the unified ecosystem uses
`mdast-util-to-hast` for transforming Markdown AST to HTML AST. This package
has a moderate severity vulnerability:

- **CVE:** CVE-2025-66400
- **GHSA:** GHSA-4fh9-h7wg-q85m
- **Severity:** Moderate (CVSS v4: 6.9/10)
- **Affected Versions:** >= 13.0.0, < 13.2.1
- **Fixed Version:** 13.2.1
- **Impact:** Multiple classnames can be injected via character references in
  markdown code blocks, potentially enabling CSS-based attacks or JavaScript
  hijacking if matching class listeners exist.

**Recommendation:** Ensure your project uses `mdast-util-to-hast` >= 13.2.1.

### KaTeX Security Consideration

The remark-math documentation notes:

> This package is safe assuming that you trust KaTeX. Any vulnerability in it
> could open you to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

When using remark-math with rehype-katex or similar KaTeX-based rendering,
ensure KaTeX is kept up to date to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

| Category              | Risk Level | Notes                              |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Direct Vulnerabilities| Low        | No known CVEs                      |
| Dependency Chain      | Low-Medium | Indirect CVE-2025-66400            |
| Maintenance           | Medium     | Inactive development               |
| Supply Chain          | Low        | Reputable maintainers (unified)    |

## Recommendations

1. **Approved for Use:** remark-math v6.0.0 has no known direct vulnerabilities
   and is safe to use.

2. **Monitor Dependencies:** Regularly run `npm audit` to catch vulnerabilities
   in transitive dependencies, particularly:
   - mdast-util-to-hast (ensure >= 13.2.1)
   - KaTeX (if using rehype-katex)

3. **Consider Alternatives:** If active maintenance is critical, monitor the
   unified ecosystem for successor packages or forks.

4. **Pin Versions:** Lock dependency versions in package-lock.json to prevent
   unexpected updates.
