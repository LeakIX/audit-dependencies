### Sources Checked

| Source | Result |
|--------|--------|
| [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/sass) | No vulnerabilities |
| [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/security/advisories) | No published advisories |

## Historical Security Issues

### Tar Permissions Issue (Fixed)

A privilege-escalation issue affected Dart Sass `.tar.gz` archives where executable
files were marked as writable by all users instead of owner-only.

- **Root Cause:** Decimal-to-octal conversion error in `cli_pkg` package (intended
  `755` but resulted in `757`)
- **Affected:** `.tar.gz` archives extracted as root user
- **NOT Affected:** Users who installed via `sass` npm package, Homebrew, or
  Chocolatey. Windows users are also not at risk.
- **Resolution:** Fixed in `cli_pkg` v2.1.7. All historical archives were
  regenerated with correct permissions.

## Dependencies

The sass package has the following runtime dependencies:

| Dependency | Version | Security Status |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| chokidar | ^4.0.0 | No vulnerabilities in v4+ |
| immutable | ^5.0.2 | No known vulnerabilities |
| source-map-js | >=0.6.2 <2.0.0 | No known vulnerabilities |

### Optional Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Security Status |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| @parcel/watcher | ^2.4.1 | No known vulnerabilities |

### Dependency Notes

- **chokidar**: Historical vulnerabilities existed in versions 2.x (CVE-2020-28469 in
  glob-parent). The sass package requires ^4.0.0, which is not affected.
- **immutable**: The Facebook `immutable` library has no known CVEs. Note: A malicious
  package `com.immutable.api.zkevm` exists with similar naming but is unrelated.
- **source-map-js**: No known vulnerabilities.

## Distinction from node-sass

**Important:** This audit is for the `sass` package (Dart Sass), NOT `node-sass`.

The `node-sass` package (LibSass wrapper) has known vulnerabilities and is deprecated:

- CVE-2020-24025: Certificate validation disabled
- CVE-2021-3918: Vulnerability in json-schema dependency
- Various LibSass C++ vulnerabilities (NULL pointer dereference, stack overflow)

**Recommendation:** If using `node-sass`, migrate to `sass` (Dart Sass).

## Package Integrity

The package is published with:

- SHA-512 integrity hash verification
- PGP signatures on npm distributions
- Cryptographic verification via keyid SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA

## Recommendations

1. **Safe to use** - No known vulnerabilities in sass v1.97.3
2. **Avoid node-sass** - Use `sass` (Dart Sass) instead of the deprecated `node-sass`
3. **Use lockfiles** - Pin exact versions in package-lock.json
4. **Enable npm audit** - Run `npm audit` regularly in CI
5. **Keep updated** - The sass team maintains an active release cadence

## Conclusion

Sass v1.97.3 has no known security vulnerabilities. The package is actively maintained
by the Sass team with a healthy release cadence. Dependencies are minimal and have no
known vulnerabilities in the versions required by this package. The historical tar
permissions issue did not affect npm package installations.
