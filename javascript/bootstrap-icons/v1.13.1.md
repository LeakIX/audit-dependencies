## Vulnerability Assessment

|--------|----------------------|
| [Snyk](https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/bootstrap-icons) | None |
| [npm Advisories](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories) | None |

### Details

**No known security vulnerabilities** have been identified for the
bootstrap-icons package across all checked sources:

- **Snyk Vulnerability Database**: No direct vulnerabilities found for any
  version of bootstrap-icons. The latest version (1.13.1) is marked as the
  latest non-vulnerable version.

- **npm Security Advisories**: No advisories filed against this package.

  security advisories.

- **ReversingLabs Spectra Assure**: Package scanned for malware, software
  tampering, risky behaviors, exposed secrets, and known vulnerabilities. No

### Important Distinction

Note that **bootstrap-icons** (the icon library) is a separate package from
**bootstrap** (the CSS/JS framework). The bootstrap framework has had several
CVEs over the years (XSS vulnerabilities in tooltips, popovers, etc.), but
these do not affect bootstrap-icons.

The CVE-2024-6531 (Bootstrap carousel XSS) advisory was
[withdrawn](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vc8w-jr9v-vj7f) in October 2025
as it was determined not to be a security issue.

## Package Health

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Maintenance | Sustainable |
| Release Cadence | Active (at least one release in past 12 months) |
| Dependencies | None (low supply chain risk) |
| Security Policy | Not established (no SECURITY.md) |

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: Low**

- Zero runtime dependencies eliminates supply chain attack vectors
- Package contains only static SVG assets and CSS
- No JavaScript execution in the package itself
- Actively maintained by official Bootstrap team
- Clean security track record

## Recommendations

1. **Safe to use**: This package has no known vulnerabilities and poses minimal
   security risk.

2. **Keep updated**: While no vulnerabilities exist, keeping dependencies
   current is good practice.

3. **Monitor advisories**: Subscribe to security notifications for the
   [twbs/icons](https://github.com/twbs/icons) repository.
