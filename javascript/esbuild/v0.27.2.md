## Historical Vulnerabilities

### GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99: CORS Misconfiguration in Development Server

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory | [GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/security/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99) |
| Severity | Moderate (5.3/10 CVSS) |
| CWE | CWE-346: Origin Validation Error |
| Affected Versions | <= 0.24.2 |
| Patched Version | >= 0.25.0 |
| Published | February 8, 2025 |

#### Description

The esbuild development server set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header on
all responses, including Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections. This overly
permissive CORS configuration allowed any website to bypass the Same-Origin
Policy and send requests to the local development server, potentially reading
source code and sensitive files.

#### Attack Scenario

1. Attacker hosts a malicious webpage
2. User visits the malicious page while running esbuild's dev server locally
3. Malicious JavaScript fetches files from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
4. Same-origin policy bypassed due to wildcard CORS headers
5. Attacker extracts compiled code, source maps, or discovers file paths

#### Impact

- Source code theft from development server
- Exposure of source maps revealing uncompiled source
- Information disclosure about project structure

#### CVSS v3.1

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
```

- Attack Vector: Network
- Attack Complexity: High
- Privileges Required: None
- User Interaction: Required
- Confidentiality Impact: High
- Integrity Impact: None
- Availability Impact: None

#### Fix

Update to esbuild >= 0.25.0. Starting with this release:

- CORS is disabled by default
- Requests are denied if the host does not match the one provided to `--serve=`
- Default host is `0.0.0.0` (all local machine IPs)

For custom CORS needs, put a proxy in front of esbuild.

## Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Build Tool Risk | Low - runs at build time, not in production |
| Dev Server Risk | Mitigated in 0.25.0+ |
| Supply Chain | Low - single maintainer (Evan Wallace), well-audited |
| Dependencies | Platform-specific optional deps only |

## Recommendations

1. **Use version >= 0.25.0** to avoid the CORS vulnerability
2. **Current version 0.27.2 is safe** for use
3. For Angular/Vite projects, use npm overrides if locked to older versions:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "esbuild": ">=0.25.0"
  }
}
```
