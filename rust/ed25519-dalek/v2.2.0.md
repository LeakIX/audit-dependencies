# Security Audit: ed25519-dalek v2.2.0

**Audit Date**: 2026-02-01
**Auditor**: Claude (AI-assisted)
**Risk Level**: LOW

## Summary

ed25519-dalek is a pure-Rust implementation of Ed25519 digital signatures, part
of the dalek-cryptography suite. This is a critical cryptography library with
87+ million downloads, actively maintained by the dalek-cryptography team. The
only known vulnerability (CVE-2022-50237) was fixed in v2.0.0, and v2.2.0 is
safe to use. The library is designed with security-first principles: constant-
time signing, automatic key zeroing, and explicit unsafe code prohibition.

## Vulnerabilities

### RUSTSEC-2022-0093 / CVE-2022-50237 (FIXED)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Advisory | RUSTSEC-2022-0093 |
| CVE | CVE-2022-50237 |
| Severity | Moderate |
| Affected Versions | < 2.0.0 |
| Patched Version | 2.0.0+ |
| Status | **FIXED in audited version** |

**Description**: Double Public Key Signing Function Oracle Attack. Pre-v2.0
versions allowed unsafe separation of private and public keys. An attacker with
signing oracle access could supply different public keys with the same message,
generating two signatures with identical R values but different S values,
enabling trivial private key extraction.

**Impact**: Total loss of confidentiality - private keys could be extracted.

**Mitigation**: Fixed in v2.0.0 by restructuring APIs to prevent decoupled
keypair usage. Hazardous operations are now explicitly marked in "hazmat" APIs.

### Related Advisories

- **GHSA-w5vr-6qhr-36cc**: Primary GitHub advisory for CVE-2022-50237
- **GHSA-j57r-4qw6-58r3**: Downstream impact on rusty-paseto (indirect)

### No New Vulnerabilities (2024-2026)

No new CVEs or security advisories have been published for ed25519-dalek since
the v2.0.0 fix. The library has undergone significant security hardening.

## Security Design

The v2.x series includes multiple security-by-design features:

- **Constant-time signing**: Prevents timing side-channel attacks
- **Automatic key zeroing**: SigningKeys zeroed on drop (via zeroize crate)
- **API safety**: Detached public keys cannot be used for signing
- **Strict verification**: `VerifyingKey::verify_strict` for strict validation
- **No unsafe code**: The crate explicitly forbids unsafe code

## Maintenance Health

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Last Stable Release | 2.2.0 (Jul 9, 2025) |
| Last Commit | Jan 25, 2026 |

| Open Issues | 109 |

**Recent Activity** (last 30 days):
- Active development on 3.0.0-pre.5 release
- Dependency updates (rand_core, getrandom)
- Performance optimizations

The project is actively maintained with regular commits and releases. The
monorepo structure (curve25519-dalek) consolidates related cryptographic
primitives including ed25519-dalek, x25519-dalek, and the core curve library.

## Dependencies

Core dependencies are well-audited cryptographic primitives:
- `curve25519-dalek`: Core elliptic curve operations
- `sha2`: SHA-512 hashing (for Ed25519)
- `zeroize`: Secure memory zeroing
- `rand_core`: RNG interface

## Approval Status

- [x] **APPROVED** for use
- [x] No known unpatched vulnerabilities
- [x] Actively maintained
- [x] Widely adopted (87M+ downloads)
- [x] Security-hardened API design
- [x] BSD-3-Clause license (permissive)

## Recommendations

1. **Use v2.2.0 or later** - Never use versions prior to v2.0.0
2. **Avoid hazmat APIs** unless you fully understand the implications
3. **Use verify_strict** when possible for additional validation
4. **Monitor for updates** - Subscribe to RUSTSEC advisories
5. **Consider v3.0.0** when stable - includes additional improvements
