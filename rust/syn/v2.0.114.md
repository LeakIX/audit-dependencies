(dtolnay) is highly respected in the Rust community and maintains numerous
critical crates including serde, thiserror, and anyhow. The extremely high
download count indicates foundational ecosystem trust and extensive real-world
testing.

## Dependencies

Syn has minimal runtime dependencies:

- `proc-macro2` - Token stream manipulation (by same author)
- `quote` - Quasi-quoting for code generation (by same author)
- `unicode-ident` - Unicode identifier validation

All dependencies are also maintained by dtolnay or have similarly trusted
ownership.

## Features

The crate provides modular features to control compilation scope:

- `derive` - Data structures for derive macros
- `parsing` - Parser combinators for syntax tree parsing
- `printing` - Pretty-printer for syntax trees via quote
- `clone-impls` - Clone implementations for syntax tree types
- `proc-macro` - Integration with native proc-macro types
- `full` - Complete Rust syntax support

## Code Quality Indicators

- Extensive test suite
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Supports Rust edition 2021
- Minimum supported Rust version: 1.68
- Dual-licensed for maximum compatibility
- Mature API (v2 series stable since 2023)

## Use Cases

- Procedural macro development
- Rust code analysis and transformation
- Custom derive implementations
- Build-time code generation

## Approval Status

- [x] APPROVED for use

**Rationale**: Syn is a foundational crate in the Rust ecosystem, used by
virtually every procedural macro. It has an impeccable security track record,
active maintenance, and trusted ownership. It is safe to use in production
systems.
