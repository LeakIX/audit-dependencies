## Security Assessment

### RustSec Advisory Database

**Status**: No known vulnerabilities

No security advisories found in the RustSec database for this crate.

### Security Considerations

1. **Proc-macro crate**: This is a procedural macro crate that runs at compile
   time, not runtime. Security risks are limited to:
   - Build-time code execution
   - Generated code correctness

2. **Minimal attack surface**: The crate only generates implementations of
   `std::error::Error`, `Display`, and `From` traits. No network access, file
   I/O, or unsafe code in typical usage.

3. **Trusted maintainer**: David Tolnay is a well-known and trusted member of
   the Rust community, maintaining many foundational crates (serde, syn, quote,
   etc.).

4. **High adoption**: With 564k dependent packages and 731M+ downloads, issues
   would be quickly identified by the community.

### Dependencies

The crate has minimal dependencies:

- `thiserror-impl` (proc-macro implementation, same author)
- Standard library traits only

## Risk Assessment

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Supply Chain | Low | Trusted maintainer, high visibility |
| Code Quality | Low | Well-tested, widely used |
| Maintenance | Low | Actively maintained |
| Security History | Low | No known vulnerabilities |
| **Overall Risk** | **Low** | Safe for production use |
