# Security Audit: argon2 v0.5.3

**Audit Date**: 2026-02-01
**Auditor**: Claude (AI-assisted)
**Risk Level**: LOW

## Summary

argon2 is a pure-Rust implementation of the Argon2 password hashing function,
part of the RustCrypto project. Argon2 won the Password Hashing Competition in
July 2015 and is the recommended algorithm for password storage. This crate
supports all three algorithmic variants (Argon2d, Argon2i, Argon2id) and has
15+ million downloads. No security vulnerabilities have been reported in the
RustSec database. The v0.5.0 release removed an unsound `parallel` feature,
demonstrating proactive security maintenance. The library follows OWASP
recommended defaults and includes memory-hardening features.

## Vulnerabilities

### No Known Vulnerabilities

No CVEs or RustSec advisories have been published for the argon2 crate. The
library has maintained a clean security record.

### Historical Security Fix (v0.5.0)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Version | 0.5.0 |
| Type | Proactive removal |
| Severity | Unknown (preemptive) |
| Status | **FIXED** |

**Description**: The `parallel` feature was removed due to unsoundness concerns.
This was a proactive security fix rather than a response to a disclosed
vulnerability. The feature has been re-added in the 0.6.0-rc series with proper
safety guarantees via rayon.

### Yanked Versions

- **v0.3.0**: Yanked (reason not specified, likely API issues)

## Algorithm Background

Argon2 is specifically designed for password hashing with the following security
properties:

- **Memory-hard**: Resists GPU/ASIC attacks by requiring large amounts of memory
- **Time-hard**: Configurable iteration count
- **Parallelism**: Can utilize multiple CPU cores (when enabled)

### Algorithmic Variants

| Variant | Use Case | Security Property |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Argon2d | Maximum GPU resistance | Data-dependent memory access |
| Argon2i | Side-channel resistance | Data-independent memory access |
| Argon2id | **Recommended default** | Hybrid approach |

## Security Design

The library includes multiple security-by-design features:

- **OWASP defaults**: `Params::DEFAULT` follows OWASP recommendations
- **Memory zeroing**: Integrates with `zeroize` crate for secure cleanup
- **Constant salt minimum**: Enforces minimum salt length requirements
- **PHC string format**: Standard format for portable password hashes
- **no_std support**: Suitable for embedded/constrained environments
- **No unsafe code**: Pure safe Rust implementation

## Maintenance Health

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Last Stable Release | 0.5.3 (Jan 20, 2024) |
| Last Pre-release | 0.6.0-rc.6 (Jan 21, 2026) |
| GitHub Stars | 857 |
| Forks | 102 |
| Open Issues | 10 |

**Recent Activity**:
- Active development on v0.6.0 release candidate series
- SIMD optimizations (AVX2) added in v0.5.1
- Upgraded to Rust 2024 edition in rc series
- Regular dependency updates

The project is actively maintained under the RustCrypto organization, which
maintains numerous cryptographic crates with consistent quality standards.

## Dependencies

Core dependencies are minimal and well-audited:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `blake2` | BLAKE2b hashing (Argon2 internal) |
| `base64ct` | Constant-time base64 encoding |
| `cpufeatures` | CPU feature detection (SIMD) |
| `password-hash` | PHC string format (optional) |
| `zeroize` | Secure memory zeroing (optional) |
| `rayon` | Parallelization (optional, rc only) |

## Approval Status

- [x] **APPROVED** for use
- [x] No known vulnerabilities
- [x] Actively maintained
- [x] Widely adopted (15M+ downloads)
- [x] Winner of Password Hashing Competition
- [x] MIT/Apache-2.0 license (permissive)

## Recommendations

1. **Use v0.5.3** - Latest stable release with all security fixes
2. **Use Argon2id** - The hybrid variant is recommended for most use cases
3. **Use OWASP defaults** - `Params::DEFAULT` provides secure parameters
4. **Enable zeroize** - Add `zeroize` feature for automatic memory cleanup
5. **Monitor for v0.6.0** - Consider upgrading when stable for SIMD improvements
6. **Salt requirements** - Always use cryptographically random 16-byte salts

### Secure Usage Example

```rust
use argon2::{Argon2, PasswordHasher, PasswordVerifier};
use argon2::password_hash::{rand_core::OsRng, SaltString};

// Hashing
let salt = SaltString::generate(&mut OsRng);
let argon2 = Argon2::default(); // Uses Argon2id with OWASP defaults
let hash = argon2.hash_password(password.as_bytes(), &salt)?;

// Verification
argon2.verify_password(password.as_bytes(), &hash)?;
```
