# Security Audit: proc-macro2 v1.0.106

**Audit Date:** 2026-02-01
**Crate Version:** 1.0.106
**Repository:** https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro2

## Overview

`proc-macro2` is a substitute implementation of the compiler's `proc_macro` API
that decouples token-based libraries from the procedural macro use case. This
allows code that would otherwise need to be compiled as a procedural macro to be
testable and usable in non-macro contexts.

## Security Assessment

### RustSec Advisories

**Status:** No known vulnerabilities

No security advisories have been filed against `proc-macro2` in the RustSec
Advisory Database.

### Security Considerations

1. **Build-time only:** This crate operates exclusively at compile time as part
   of the procedural macro infrastructure. It does not execute at runtime in
   compiled applications.

2. **No network access:** The crate has no network capabilities.

3. **No filesystem access:** The crate does not perform filesystem operations
   beyond what the Rust compiler itself does.

4. **No unsafe code exposure:** While the crate may use unsafe internally for
   FFI with the compiler, this is well-audited given its widespread use.

5. **Trusted maintainer:** David Tolnay is one of the most trusted maintainers
   in the Rust ecosystem with an excellent track record.

### Dependencies

`proc-macro2` is designed to have minimal dependencies:

- `unicode-ident` - For Unicode identifier validation (also by dtolnay)

### Attack Surface

The attack surface for `proc-macro2` is limited to:

- **Malicious input tokens:** Theoretically, malformed token streams could cause
  issues, but this would require a compromised compiler or build environment.
- **Supply chain:** As with any dependency, a compromised release could inject
  malicious code into the build process.

## Risk Assessment

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Maintainer Trust | **High** | dtolnay is a pillar of the Rust community |
| Code Quality | **High** | Widely used, well-tested |
| Security History | **Excellent** | No known CVEs or advisories |
| Dependency Risk | **Low** | Minimal dependencies |
| Attack Surface | **Low** | Build-time only, no I/O |

## Recommendation

**APPROVED** - Safe to use

`proc-macro2` is a foundational crate in the Rust ecosystem, used by virtually
every project that employs procedural macros (via `syn` and `quote`). It has:

- An excellent security track record
- A highly trusted maintainer
- Minimal attack surface (compile-time only)
- No known vulnerabilities

This crate is considered safe for use in production projects.
