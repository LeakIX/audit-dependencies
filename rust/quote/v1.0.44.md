| Author | David Tolnay (dtolnay) |
| Minimum Rust Version | 1.68 |

## Description

Quasi-quoting macro `quote!(...)` for converting syntax tree data structures
into source code tokens. Widely used in procedural macro development for
generating Rust code programmatically.

## Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies

| Crate | Version Requirement | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| proc-macro2 | ^1.0.80 | Core dependency for token manipulation |

### Dev Dependencies

| Crate | Version Requirement | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| rustversion | ^1.0 | Version detection for tests |
| trybuild | ^1.0.108 | Compile-fail test framework |

## Security Analysis

### RustSec Advisory Database

**Status: No known vulnerabilities**

The RustSec Advisory Database contains no security advisories for the `quote`
crate as of 2026-02-01.

### GitHub Security Advisories

**Status: No published advisories**

The repository's security tab shows zero security advisories.

### Security Policy

The project's SECURITY.md instructs reporters to create a public issue in the
repository for vulnerability disclosure. This differs from typical private
disclosure practices.

### Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | Assessment | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| Code Execution | Low | Generates code at compile-time only |
| Memory Safety | Low | No unsafe code in core functionality |
| Supply Chain | Low | Single runtime dependency (proc-macro2) |
| Maintenance | Active | Regular releases, responsive maintainer |
| Adoption | Very High | 941,000+ dependent packages |

### Threat Model

The `quote` crate operates exclusively at compile-time:

1. **No runtime code execution** - Generates TokenStream at compile time
2. **No network access** - Pure code generation
3. **No file system access** - Works only with in-memory token streams
4. **No unsafe code** - Safe Rust implementation

Primary security considerations:

- **Macro hygiene**: The crate properly handles identifier hygiene to prevent
  accidental variable capture
- **Input validation**: Accepts arbitrary TokenStream input; malformed input
  would cause compile errors rather than security issues
- **Dependency chain**: Depends only on proc-macro2, which is also maintained
  by the same author and has no known vulnerabilities

## Audit Conclusion

**Risk Level: LOW**

The `quote` crate presents minimal security risk:

1. No known vulnerabilities in RustSec or GitHub Security Advisories
2. Compile-time only operation with no runtime attack surface
3. Minimal dependency tree (single runtime dependency)
4. Active maintenance by a trusted, prolific Rust ecosystem maintainer
5. Extremely high adoption indicating extensive community review

**Recommendation: APPROVED for use**
