# Security Audit: proptest v1.9.0

**Audit Date:** 2026-02-01
**Crate:** proptest
**Version:** 1.9.0
**License:** MIT OR Apache-2.0

## Overview

Proptest is a Hypothesis-like property-based testing and shrinking framework for
Rust. It generates random test inputs and automatically shrinks failing cases
to minimal reproducible examples.

## Risk Assessment

### Strengths

1. **High adoption:** Over 90 million downloads indicates wide usage and
   community scrutiny
2. **No known vulnerabilities:** Clean RustSec record
3. **Dual license:** Permissive MIT/Apache-2.0 licensing
4. **Active CI:** Build status passing
5. **Dev-only usage:** Typically used as dev-dependency, limiting production
   exposure

### Concerns

1. **Passive maintenance:** Repository explicitly states passive maintenance
   status
2. **No security policy:** No formal process for reporting vulnerabilities
3. **118 open issues:** Moderate backlog of open issues
4. **No formal audit:** No known third-party security audit

### Use Case Considerations

Proptest is a **testing framework** and is typically used as a `dev-dependency`.
This significantly reduces security risk since:

- Code is not included in production binaries
- Vulnerabilities would primarily affect development/CI environments
- Attack surface is limited to test execution context

## Recommendation

**APPROVED for dev-dependency use**

Proptest is a well-established property-based testing framework with no known
security vulnerabilities. Its use as a dev-dependency limits exposure. The
passive maintenance status is acceptable for a mature testing tool.

### Suggested Usage

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
proptest = "1.9"
```
