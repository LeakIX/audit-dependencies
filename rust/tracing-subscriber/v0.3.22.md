## Security Advisories

### RUSTSEC-2025-0055: ANSI Escape Sequence Injection

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Advisory ID | RUSTSEC-2025-0055 |
| CVE | CVE-2025-58160 |
| GHSA | GHSA-xwfj-jgwm-7wp5 |
| Category | Format-injection |
| Reported | August 29, 2025 |
| Issued | September 2, 2025 |
| Affected Versions | < 0.3.20 |
| Patched Versions | >= 0.3.20 |

**Description:**

The tracing-subscriber crate was vulnerable to ANSI escape sequence injection.
When logging untrusted user input, attackers could inject control sequences to
manipulate terminal behavior, including:

- Altering terminal title bars
- Clearing screens
- Modifying display output
- Potentially exploiting terminal emulator vulnerabilities

**Status:** FIXED in v0.3.22

The fix implements escaping of ANSI control characters (PR #3368).
