## Security Assessment

### RustSec Advisory Database

**Status:** No known vulnerabilities

No security advisories have been filed against the `serde_json` crate in the
RustSec Advisory Database. The local `cargo-audit` database also reports no
advisories for this crate.

### Related Crate Advisories

The following advisories exist for related but distinct crates:

| Advisory | Crate | Severity | Description |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| RUSTSEC-2024-0012 | serde-json-wasm | High (CVSS 7.5) | Stack overflow during recursive JSON parsing |
| RUSTSEC-2025-0068 | serde_yml | - | Unsound emitter causing segfault; crate archived |

**Note:** These advisories do NOT affect `serde_json`. The `serde-json-wasm`
crate is a separate WebAssembly-specific implementation.

### CVE Records

No CVE records found for `serde_json`.

### Security Considerations

1. **Recursion Depth:** While `serde_json` does not have a known vulnerability,
   deeply nested JSON can consume stack space. Production systems processing
   untrusted JSON should consider recursion limits if memory constraints are
   critical.

2. **Denial of Service:** Large JSON payloads can consume significant memory.
   Applications should validate input size before parsing untrusted data.

3. **Numeric Precision:** JSON numbers are parsed as f64 by default, which may
   lose precision for very large integers. Use `serde_json::Number` or custom
   deserializers for arbitrary precision needs.

## Dependency Analysis

`serde_json` has minimal dependencies:

- `serde` - Core serialization framework (same maintainer)
- `itoa` - Integer to string conversion (same maintainer)
- `memchr` - Optimized byte searching (same maintainer)
- `ryu` - Float to string conversion (same maintainer)

All core dependencies are maintained by the same author (David Tolnay),
reducing supply chain risk.

## Maintenance Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Last Release | 2026-01-06 (< 1 month ago) |
| Release Frequency | Active (6 releases in last 6 months) |
| Open Issues | Actively triaged |
| Stars | 5.5k |

## Audit Result

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| RustSec Advisories | PASS |
| CVE Records | PASS |
| Active Maintenance | PASS |
| Trusted Maintainer | PASS |
| Minimal Dependencies | PASS |

**Overall Assessment:** APPROVED

`serde_json` is a foundational Rust crate with no known security vulnerabilities,
maintained by a highly trusted member of the Rust community. The crate has an
excellent security track record and is safe for use in production systems.
